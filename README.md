# IM-HNGRY
 Get to food, faster!

 ### Overview
 For this project, the idea is to solve the age-old college student problem of finding something to eat after a party, study session, or just when you're HNGRY. The aim is to have an application (for now, mostly backend, possibly using Ktor or similar) to fetch the restaurants closest to you which are currently open, in order of least time to eat. That is, combining factors like average wait times, type of restaurant, and distance to you, the app will try to determine which is the fastest food you can get when you are really just HNGRY.
